Special Considerations:

All of the mandatory data structures have been fully implemented and completed. 

All of the mandatory data structures also function completely independently from
each other, except for the BinarySearchTree class. It utilizes this portfolio's 
Queue class to print out the tree.

The Queue and Stack classes where designed intially from work I did in Java
and have been converted into C#. 

The four extra data structures are MaxHeapSort, Trie, HashTable, and BloomFilter.
Initially I had the DoubleEndedQueue in the portfolio, but I had taken it out due not 
being satisified with my implementation.
